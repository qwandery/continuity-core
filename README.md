# continuity-core

Experience truly epic adventures with the Continuity Core Roleplaying System -- an elegant, setting-agnostic RPG system. Employs a unique 2d12 dice mechanic and a focus on semi-realism.

## Overview

Continuity Core is a mechanics-oriented system, inspired more by classic RPG systems than modern "cinematic" or "narrative"-focused systems. In other words, player characters are governed by the same rules as everyone else in the world, and the system tries to a reasonable degree to model the world and everything that happens in it in a suitably realistic or believable way. That said, the system is also designed to be simple, consistent, easy to learn and remember, while also being modular and easy to extend or customize while preserving balance.

## Goals

* Basic rules & mechanics are simple and intuitive
  * Easy for new players to learn the basics
  * Easy for all players to remember the basics
  * Quick and easy to apply the rules, so there's less need to look up the rules and bog down the game when the action's happening

* Basic rules are consistent and universal
  * Even complex scenarios are natural extensions of the basic mechanics
  * Generic and adaptable to many situations, with clear extension points

* Character progression is continuous and rewarding
  * Characters are not defined by restrictive classes or levels, but by "skill-tree" inspired progression paths
  * Progress rewards are meaningful yet occur with consistent frequency
  * Multiple progression paths available to characters simultaneously
  * Character progression balanced to reward & support strong role-play
  * Character progression does not end in a "god scenario" but encourages ongoing development without eliminating inherent "human" weakness

* Modular and extensible
  * Basic rules provide a clear, flexible structure with obvious/well-defined extension points
  * Basic rules are generic and adaptable to many settings and play styles
  * Clear guidelines, rules, and examples provided for extending the basic ruleset while preserving 

* Flexible yet Balanced
  * Player Characters of all backgrounds have equal capability to shine
  * Easy for GMs to balance encounters by weighing PC capabilities against challenges
  * Characters, challenges, and in "layers"

* Mechanics are believable, but not obtrusive

  * Provides a satisfying approximation of reality
  * Ensures a level playing field -- PCs, NPCs, monsters, etc. are all governed by the same rules
  * Allows players to feel accomplished when they succeed, and feel genuinely threatened when things get dangerous
  * Provides straightforward rules and guidelines for quickly adjudicating challenges of any complexity
  * Strives to approximate, but NOT simulate, the real world -- favors quick judgement-calls based on simple guidelines, over complex, detailed rules
